# fizzbuzz
This repository is for the ruby 'fizzbuzz' challenge. 
A short task set by Maker's Academy to help learn TDD fundamentals using RSpec.
The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

- The program can be passed a number.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
-When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
-In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/oliverpople/fizzbuzz.git`
`$ gem install rspec` (if rspec is not already installed)

## Usage

`ruby fizzbuzz.rb (number)`


## Running tests

`rspec fizzbuzz_spec.rb`
